Ideas for further development:

1. More side missions:

- Work on modular side missions.
- Re-working older side missions.

2. AO sub-objectives.

3. SQL Database and further player & mission persistence.

4. Zeus: build up a large number of potential zeus operators in the community, with a goal of 24/7 coverage of Zeus on the server.

5. New HQ compositions/fortifications.

6. Port to new Global Mobilization DLC terrain.
