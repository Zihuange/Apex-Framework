For security reasons we have disabled a number of script commands associated with common cheat scripts and not associated with mission/framework scripts, for instance the "onMapSingleClick" command, and one syntax of the "createUnit" command.

These can be viewed/modified in description.ext file.

If you are heavily modifying this framework and some things are not working for no apparent reason, its a good idea to know which commands are disabled.

Here is a rough list of what is disabled by default (as of 1.1.9):

createUnit (syntax with init field)
addMPEventHandler
publicVariable
onMapSingleClick
allVariables (namespace syntax)
hint
hintSilent
onEachFrame

Note:

	In 1.2.0 we have re-enabled "setMarkerText" to allow Zeus to edit marker text. To further lock down security, you can disable this command.
