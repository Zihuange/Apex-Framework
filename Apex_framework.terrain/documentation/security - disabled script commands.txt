For security reasons we have disabled a number of script commands associated with common cheat scripts and not associated with mission/framework scripts, for instance the "onMapSingleClick" command, and one syntax of the "createUnit" command.

These can be viewed/modified in description.ext file.

If you are heavily modifying this framework and some things are not working for no apparent reason, its a good idea to know which commands are disabled.

Here is a rough list of what is disabled by default (as of 1.1.2):


createUnit (syntax with init field)
setMarkerText
addMPEventHandler
publicVariable
onMapSingleClick
allVariables (namespace syntax)
hint
hintSilent
